# Deploying a Synapse Homeserver with Docker

This section is dedicated to setting up a Synapse server from scratch using Docker Compose, complete with PostgreSQL, Nginx, and multiple Synapse workers.

The end result should be a powerful, self-hosted communication platform. And as always, if questions pop up or you hit a snag, the [Synapse Admins](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) room is there to lend a hand.
