# Matrix Synapse Homeserver Guides

This section of my website aim's to be a one-stop hub for getting into the Matrix ecosystem and making the most of a Synapse server, from configuring it for the first time to delving into more complex development.

Synapse is the reference homeserver for the Matrix ecosystem – an open-source, decentralised communication platform. It's incredibly flexible, letting you chat, call, and custom-build your own communication solutions.

Getting started with Synapse can be daunting though, so I'm collating a range of guides and resources - from straightforward installation walkthroughs to more intricate development tips, I hope there'll be something for everyone.

If you have any questions, just drop in to the [Synapse Admins](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) room and we'll do our best to help. Now, time to roll up your sleeves, and let's get started!
