## 5. Conclusion

And there you have it! A dedicated backup replica for your PostgreSQL database in Docker.

**Remember:** this is a general guide that should work for a lot of people, but it's impossible to cover every scenario, so if you've read this far, it's recommended to try with a test database first, and spend some time deciding whether this solution is for you.

For potential troubleshooting or further reading, consider referring to [the official Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/logical-replication.html) on replication and backups.
