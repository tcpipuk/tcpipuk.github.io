# Setting Up a Replica for Backups for PostgreSQL in Docker

## Introduction

Backing up a write-heavy database like Synapse can be a challenge: in my case, a dump of the database would take >15 minutes and cause all sorts of performance and locking issues in the process.

This guide will walk you through setting up replication from a primary PostgreSQL Docker container to a secondary container dedicated for backups.

By the end, you'll have a backup system that's efficient, minimizes performance hits, and ensures data safety.
