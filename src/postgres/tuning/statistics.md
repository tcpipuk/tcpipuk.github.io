# Tuning PostgreSQL for a Matrix Synapse Homeserver

## Statistics Modules

Some of the following sections will rely on statistics generated by either `pg_buffercache` or `pg_stat_statements`, which are optional modules included with PostgreSQL that offer statistics on various tasks that PostgreSQL has seen.

These extensions cause PostgreSQL to use slightly more shared memory, and a few percent higher CPU tim - there's no direct harm in leaving them running, but if your objective is for maximum performance, after enabling them and completing your investigation, you can disable them again in the [Disabling Statistics](#disabling-statistics) section below

### Enabling Statistics

1. Open your `postgresql.conf` file, search for the `shared_preload_libraries` setting, then add `pg_buffercache,pg_stat_statements` to its value (making sure to comma-separate each entry).

   If it's not present, simply add the following line:

   ```ini,icon=.devicon-postgresql-plain,filepath=postgresql.conf
   shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_buffercache,pg_stat_statements'
   ```

2. Restart the PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect, then run these queries:

   ```sql,icon=.devicon-postgresql-plain,filepath=psql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_buffercache;
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
   ```

### Resetting Statistics

To reset the statistics collected by `pg_stat_statements`, you can execute the following command:

```sql,icon=.devicon-postgresql-plain,filepath=psql
SELECT pg_stat_reset();
```

If your server has been running a long time, it's definitely worth running this to ensure you're looking at fresh numbers.

You can check when the stats were last reset for each database using a query like this:

```sql,icon=.devicon-postgresql-plain,filepath=psql
SELECT datname AS database,
       stats_reset AS stats_last_reset
FROM pg_stat_database
WHERE datname
NOT LIKE 'template%';

  datname  |          stats_reset
-----------+-------------------------------
 synapse   | 2023-12-22 12:13:28.708593+00
(1 row)
```

(Note: An empty value here would mean the stats have never been reset, according to PostgreSQL's records)

### Disabling Statistics

Once you're done investigating, there's no need to remove the line from `postgresql.conf` - simply run the queries below to disable the extensions, so they'll stop running, but be available next time you need them:

```sql,icon=.devicon-postgresql-plain,filepath=psql
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS pg_buffercache;
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```
