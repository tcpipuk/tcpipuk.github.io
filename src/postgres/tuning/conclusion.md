# Tuning PostgreSQL for a Matrix Synapse Homeserver

## Conclusion

Throughout this guide, we've touched on key areas such as network configuration, worker alignment,
memory management, regular maintenance, replication strategies, and systematic testing, but
performance tuning PostgreSQL is more than a technical exercise; it's a philosophy of continuous
improvement, adaptability, and understanding.

This is very much a starting point for anyone interested in making the most of their hardware, and
a well-tuned system is not a destination but a journey: if you embrace the process, apply the
principles, and let the knowledge you've acquired today guide you towards a more efficient and
reliable Synapse environment, hopefully you'll be empowered to manage your own configuration to
meet all demands for many years to come.
