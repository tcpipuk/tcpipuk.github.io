# PostgreSQL for Synapse Homeservers

Welcome to my PostgreSQL guides! If you're here, you're likely interested in optimising and understanding how PostgreSQL works with your Matrix Synapse Homeserver.

PostgreSQL (or usually Postgres) is an advanced, open-source relational database system. It's known for its robustness, performance, and compatibility with a wide range of applications, so it's become a popular choice for businesses, developers, and system administrators alike.

In the context of Matrix Synapse, PostgreSQL plays a crucial role. Synapse manages a significant amount of data â€“ ranging from user information to message history, and all the complex interactions in between. The database is the backbone of this operation, ensuring data integrity, security, and accessibility. Properly tuning and managing your PostgreSQL database is key to maintaining a responsive and efficient Synapse server.

This section aims to guide you through various aspects of PostgreSQL in relation to Synapse. Whether you're setting up PostgreSQL for the first time or looking to optimise an existing database, you'll hopefully find insights and instructions tailored to your needs. From basic configuration to advanced tuning, I'll try to cover a range of topics to help you get the most out of your server.

Remember, each Synapse server is unique, and so are its database requirements. This guide aims to provides general advice and best practices, but it's important for you to assess and adapt these recommendations to fit your specific situation.
